# Progressive Refactoring Plan: Graph-Aware Entity Recognition & Node Simplification

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive refactoring plan based on critical analysis of the current agent architecture. The plan addresses two major areas of concern:

1. **Entity Recognition & Progressive Context Disclosure** ✅ **PHASE 1 COMPLETED** - Graph-aware entity resolution system implemented
2. **Node Proliferation & Over-Engineering** - Unnecessary complexity in tool execution and routing

## Current Problems Summary

### Entity Recognition Issues ✅ PHASE 1 RESOLVED
- ✅ **Graph-aware entity recognition** - Entities now resolved with graph context
- ✅ **Progressive entity extraction** - Intent parsed first, then entities with graph context
- ✅ **Entity deduplication** - Proper entity linking and candidate matching
- ✅ **Meaningful confidence scores** - Multi-dimensional scoring based on graph similarity
- ✅ **Disambiguation support** - Ambiguity resolution with user interaction

### Node Architecture Issues
- ✅ **Unnecessary indirection** - `route_tool` + `call_tool` doing one job → `execute_tool` (solved in Phase 4)
- ❌ **State bloat** - Passing everything through every node (solved in Phase 3)
- ✅ **Routing nodes as if-statements** - `route_after_parse`, `route_after_evaluate` → conditional edges (solved in Phase 4)
- ✅ **Duplicate state storage** - Tool names stored multiple times → single source of truth (solved in Phase 4)
- ✅ **Meaningless intermediate results** - Status fields that convey no information → clear, actionable updates (solved in Phase 4)

## Refactoring Phases
