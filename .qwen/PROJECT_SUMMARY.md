# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Set up and test both backend and frontend Docker build images for the Puntini Agent application.

## Key Knowledge
- Backend technology stack includes Python 3.11, FastAPI, LangGraph, LangChain, Neo4j, and Langfuse
- Frontend technology stack includes React Router, Vite, and Node.js
- The backend uses a Dockerfile based on python:3.11-slim image
- The frontend uses a Dockerfile based on node:20-alpine image
- Backend application configuration is loaded from config.json (with Docker-specific config at config.json.docker)
- Frontend connects to backend at http://localhost:8025 and runs on port 8026
- Backend server runs on port 8025 with API documentation available at /docs
- Docker builds exclude logs, .env files, and other development artifacts via .dockerignore
- Docker images require sudo privileges to build and run on most systems

## Recent Actions
- Analyzed backend Docker configuration including Dockerfile, requirements.txt, run_server.py, and config.json.docker
- Created test scripts for Docker image building and container testing:
  - Simple build and run scripts for both backend and frontend
  - Comprehensive tests with health checks and container management for both backend and frontend
  - Docker image analysis scripts
- Created documentation with instructions for testing the Docker builds
- Made all scripts executable for easy testing
- Set up frontend Docker configuration with proper port and backend connection settings

## Current Plan
1. [DONE] Analyze backend Docker configuration
2. [DONE] Create test scripts for Docker image building and testing
3. [DONE] Create documentation for Docker testing
4. [DONE] Analyze frontend Docker configuration
5. [DONE] Create frontend Docker test scripts and documentation
6. [TODO] Run comprehensive Docker tests to validate image build and container execution for both backend and frontend
7. [TODO] Verify API endpoints are accessible when backend container is running
8. [TODO] Verify frontend is accessible and can connect to backend when both containers are running
9. [TODO] Analyze Docker image size and layers for optimization opportunities
