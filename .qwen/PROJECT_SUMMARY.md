# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Set up and test both backend and frontend Docker build images for the Puntini Agent application with comprehensive testing and documentation.

## Key Knowledge
- Python virtual env in venv folder
- Backend technology stack: Python 3.11, FastAPI, LangGraph, LangChain, Neo4j, and Langfuse
- Frontend technology stack: React Router, Vite, and Node.js
- Backend Docker image based on python:3.11-slim, runs on port 8025
- Frontend Docker image based on node:20-alpine, runs on port 8026
- Frontend configured to connect to backend at http://localhost:8025
- Docker builds exclude logs, .env files, and development artifacts via .dockerignore
- Docker images require sudo privileges to build and run on most systems
- GitHub Actions workflows automate Docker testing for both backend and frontend

## Recent Actions
- Created comprehensive Docker test scripts for both backend and frontend applications
- Set up GitHub Actions workflows for automated Docker testing and building
- Configured Dockerfiles with proper port configurations (8025 for backend, 8026 for frontend)
- Added environment variables for frontend-backend communication
- Created documentation files for Docker usage (DOCKER_TESTING.md, FRONTEND_DOCKER_TESTING.md)
- Updated main documentation files (README.md, AGENTS.md, GEMINI.md) with Docker and GitHub Actions information
- Made all test scripts executable for easy testing
- Created branch 'feat/docker-build' and committed all changes

## Current Plan
1. [DONE] Analyze backend Docker configuration
2. [DONE] Create test scripts for Docker image building and testing
3. [DONE] Create documentation for Docker testing
4. [DONE] Analyze frontend Docker configuration
5. [DONE] Create frontend Docker test scripts and documentation
6. [DONE] Set up GitHub Actions workflows for both backend and frontend
7. [DONE] Update project documentation with Docker information
8. [DONE] Create and commit changes to 'feat/docker-build' branch
9. [TODO] Run comprehensive Docker tests to validate image build and container execution for both backend and frontend
10. [TODO] Verify API endpoints are accessible when backend container is running
11. [TODO] Verify frontend is accessible and can connect to backend when both containers are running
12. [TODO] Analyze Docker image size and layers for optimization opportunities
