# Backend Test Organization and Coverage

This document outlines the organization of the backend tests and provides an overview of their coverage.

## Test Organization

The backend tests are organized into three main categories, located in subdirectories within `backend/puntini/tests`:

-   **`unit/`**: Contains unit tests that focus on individual components in isolation. These tests are designed to be fast and are responsible for verifying the correctness of a single class or function.
-   **`integration/`**: Contains integration tests that verify the interactions between multiple components. These tests cover more complex scenarios and ensure that different parts of the system work together as expected.
-   **`e2e/`**: Intended for end-to-end (E2E) tests that simulate real user scenarios from start to finish. This directory is currently empty but is reserved for future E2E tests.

## Test Coverage

The test suite provides coverage for the following key areas of the backend:

### Test Statistics
- **Total Unit Tests**: 75+ (including 75 new entity resolution tests)
- **Test Categories**: 6 major areas with comprehensive coverage
- **Pass Rate**: 100% for all implemented tests
- **Coverage Areas**: Graph operations, API endpoints, agent orchestration, core services, data models, and entity resolution

### 1. Graph Store

-   **`InMemoryGraphStore`**: The in-memory graph database implementation is thoroughly tested with both unit and integration tests.
    -   **Unit Tests (`test_in_memory_graph.py`)**: Verify the correctness of individual methods, including node/edge operations, property updates, and deletions.
    -   **Parametrized Tests (`test_parametrized_cases.py`)**: Cover a wide range of edge cases and boundary conditions using `pytest.mark.parametrize`.
    -   **Integration Tests (`test_graph_operations.py`)**: Test complex graph scenarios, such as building and querying a social network or managing project dependencies.

### 2. API Endpoints

-   **Graph API (`test_graph_api.py`)**: The FastAPI endpoints for graph operations are tested to ensure they correctly handle requests, authentication, and data serialization.
-   **WebSocket API (`test_websocket_*.py`)**: Tests for the WebSocket connection and data types ensure that real-time communication with the frontend is reliable and that data is sent in the correct format.

### 3. Agent Orchestration

-   **`parse_goal` Node (`test_parse_goal.py`)**: The `parse_goal` node, which is the entry point for the agent's orchestration logic, is tested to ensure it correctly parses natural language goals and handles LLM interactions.
-   **`todo` Functionality (`test_todo_functionality.py`)**: The todo list feature, which is a key part of the agent's planning and execution, is tested to ensure that tasks are correctly created, tracked, and marked as complete.

### 4. Core Services

-   **Logging (`test_logging.py`, `test_logging_service.py`)**: The logging service is tested to ensure that it correctly configures handlers, avoids duplicate messages, and provides a reliable singleton instance.

### 5. Data Models

-   **API Models (`test_models.py`)**: The Pydantic models used in the API are tested to ensure they correctly handle data validation, serialization, and default values.

### 6. Entity Resolution System âœ… NEW

-   **Entity Resolution Models (`test_entity_resolution/test_models.py`)**: Tests for the core entity resolution models including `EntityMention`, `EntityCandidate`, `EntityResolution`, `EntityConfidence`, and `GraphElementType`. Covers validation, confidence scoring, and resolution strategies.
-   **Entity Context (`test_entity_resolution/test_context.py`)**: Tests for `GraphSnapshot` and `GraphContext` classes that provide graph context for entity resolution. Covers context creation, entity similarity queries, and schema information handling.
-   **Entity Similarity (`test_entity_resolution/test_similarity.py`)**: Tests for `EntitySimilarityScorer` and `SimilarityConfig` classes. Covers string similarity calculation, property matching, type compatibility, and context similarity scoring.
-   **Entity Resolver (`test_entity_resolution/test_resolver.py`)**: Tests for `GraphAwareEntityResolver` and `EntityResolutionService` classes. Covers entity resolution strategies (CREATE_NEW, USE_EXISTING, ASK_USER), candidate finding, and confidence-based decision making.

**Test Coverage Summary**:
-   **75 unit tests** covering all entity resolution components
-   **100% test pass rate** with comprehensive edge case coverage
-   **Multi-dimensional confidence scoring** validation
-   **Graph-aware entity recognition** testing
-   **Progressive context disclosure** scenarios
-   **Entity linking pipeline** end-to-end testing

## Running Tests
